# bbpool2024
Annual friends baseball pool site.

Note to self: use Google sheets  for the draft/protected list

at the beginning of the season we need to:
- update the year in a number of places (page and documentation titles, fetch urls, etc)
- each player needs a unique 'nickname' to bridge unique/foreign key links for players with no official record at mlb yet
- when we copy over the roster json it is important to zero out the totals of each player to avoid distortion at the beginning of the year.

It hosts 4 teams with protected rosters between seasons and then facilitates a draft before the season to fill out unprotected positions in each roster.

Players are mapped to player id properties from the mlb stats db.

On demand the latest stats are pulled from the api and a React context state store is created and cached for the duration of the visit.

The project needs a '/bak' folder to be created on the root to write backup roster files to

Each roster is comprised of top players at each of the main positions scoring based on key stats
hitters: runs, hits, HR's, rbi, sb
starters: wins, losses, and k's
closers: wins, saves, k's

Hosted using Vercel app hosting - pretty slick

## Developing locally
This is a Next js application so has a built in server / api  
The api uses the same host and port with the path `/api/...`  
Note this is only for local development as there is no api in production as there is no persistence.  

```
$npm run dev
```
should come up on port 2024

### isHiddenOn
is the switch to turn on local editing controls in index.js
```
  const [isHiddenOn, setIsHiddenOn] = useState(true);
```

```
hiiter total calc:
      totalVal = (baseValObj.r) + (baseValObj.h / 2) + (baseValObj.rbi) + (baseValObj.hr * 2) + (baseValObj.sb / 2);

      starter totals:
       totalVal = ((baseValObj.w * 15) - (baseValObj.l * 4) + (baseValObj.k / 2));

       closer totals
           totalVal = (baseValObj.sv * 7) + (baseValObj.w * 6) + (baseValObj.k / 2) + (baseValObj.ip / 2);


```
## moving players around after a trade
- this is a pretty manual process
- add players to new rosters
- delete players from old roster
- manulally update rosters.json to change prospects to regular status
- remap the player ids
- click 'process nicknames' button to update roster so they score

special note of appreciation for mlb to be ok with small fish accessing their stats api.
